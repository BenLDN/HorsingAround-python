Random python code - nothing useful

Hashcrack: trying to brute-force an SHA-512 hash to get the input string (password)

Hashit: generating the following hashes from a string input: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512.

Rockpaperscissors: playing RPS with the user. Stroring the user's choices in a txt file, identifying the most common choice and determining the hand that wins against that choice.
